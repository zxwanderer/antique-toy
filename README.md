**TL;DR:** 23 chapters + 10 appendices, ~184K words, 29 compilable examples, 4 languages. You know Z80 -- this book shows you *why* the tricks work, not *what* the registers are. [Download PDF](https://github.com/oisee/antique-toy/releases/download/v17/book-a4-v17.pdf)

This book lives on the **ZX Spectrum**. Most techniques -- DOWN_HL, attribute tricks, ULA timing, 128K bank juggling -- only make sense on this machine. That's where the demoscene is, and that's where the hard problems are.

The foundation (T-state budgets, fixed-point maths, compression, algorithms) is pure Z80 and works on any platform. One chapter takes the whole game to **eZ80/Agon Light 2** (~$50 on Olimex) to show how the same instruction set drives a completely different machine.

Not a beginner tutorial, not a reference manual. A cookbook for those who already know Z80 and want to understand *why* the tricks work.

## How to read this book

Chapter 1 (T-state budgets) is the foundation -- read it first. Everything after that can be read in any order, like a recipe book. Linear "here are registers, here are instructions" exposition is the "car manual from the glovebox" experience. If you already know Z80, you don't need that.

## Building the book

Requires [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and LuaLaTeX (TeX Live).

```sh
python3 build_book.py --pdf            # A4 PDF (English)
python3 build_book.py --all            # PDF A4 + A5 + EPUB

## Building the code examples

Requires [sjasmplus](https://github.com/z00m128/sjasmplus) (pinned as submodule in `tools/sjasmplus/`).

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/oisee/antique-toy.git
cd antique-toy
make            # compile all 28 examples
make test       # assemble all, report pass/fail

## Contributing

The book is about Z80 as a processor, not just ZX Spectrum as a platform. If you have materials on other Z80 machines -- Amstrad CPC, MSX, ZX Next, Robotron KC85, or anything else with a Z80 inside -- PRs are welcome. Clone the repo, add your chapter or appendix, rebuild the book.

Translations are managed via two tools:
- `translations/manifest.py` -- SHA256-based file-level staleness tracking
- `translations/tm.py` -- paragraph-level Translation Memory for incremental retranslation (87% reuse rate, ~89% cost savings vs full retranslation)

See `translations/README-tm.md` for the TM workflow.

## Companion projects

### Antique Toy (demo)

An AI-assisted multi-effect ZX Spectrum demo in `demo/src/`. Currently includes a wireframe torus with real-time rotation. More effects planned (plasma, backface culling).

### Clockwork (demo toolchain)

[Clockwork](https://github.com/oisee/clockwork) is the companion toolchain for ZX Spectrum demo production. It connects the book's theory to practical demo-making workflow: timeline editing, music sync, memory budgeting, and asset pipeline management. The `--json` output from `tools/packbench.py` feeds directly into Clockwork's memory planner.

### Tools

The `tools/` directory contains Python utilities developed alongside the book:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `packbench.py` | Packer benchmark, memory budget, streaming decompression estimator, pre-compression data analysis |
| `screenshots.py` | Automated screenshot generation for book illustrations (28 examples, headless emulator) |
| `manage_listings.py` | Code listing extraction, injection, and verification across chapters |
| `audit_tstates.py` | T-state annotation auditor — compares inline comments with computed cycle counts |
| `autotag.py` | Semi-automatic code block classifier and tagger |
| `translations/tm.py` | Translation Memory: paragraph-level diff, delta export, merge for incremental retranslation |
